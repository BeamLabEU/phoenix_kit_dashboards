  Exercises `migrated_version_runtime/1` against a real database — the read
  path the pure data/string tests in `migrations_test.exs` cannot cover (see
  that file's moduledoc: none of its tests touch a database). A regression in
  the SELECT itself (broken join, wrong classoid) would leave that suite
  green while this function permanently returns 0 in production, and callers
  (status/update task) would never see the real installed version.

  `async: false` — each test mutates the table-level COMMENT rather than rows.
